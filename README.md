## Problem Statement

What is the problem you are aiming to solve? Who are your target users?

## Impact

Briefly explain how the project meets a real-world need.

## Prior Work

Include any existing solutions and explain how you plan on differentiating your product. You should have ~10 different sources. These can range from commercial/competitive solutions to research papers that inform some part of your product. 

## Proposed Solution

Briefly describe your proposed solution.  How does it work and what does it do?

## Team

Who are your team members? Identify what skills each team member brings to the table as well as preferred work style (take charge, work alone, pair programming, etc).

## Strategy

Outline your development strategy with general feature milestones - identify minimum viable product features and optional stretch goals. Explain how you plan to test your product.

## Implementation Challenges

What development challenges have you thought about so far?  Identify any risks and briefly discuss possible workarounds / alternatives. 

## Meeting Schedule

You are required to spend at least 10 hours/week on development. Outline a general weekly meeting schedule with at least 1 time that everybody can make. At least that one meeting must include the entire team in the same room, in person. The rest of the 10 hours may be split into several sessions throughout the week. A nice tool for this is [when2meet](https://www.when2meet.com/).
